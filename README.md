# A very old calculator
I was in a class of electronic circuit design when the instructor got this thing out of his pocket. It was a little bigger than a pack of king-sized cigarettes. He switched it on and blinking red numbers started to appear. We all dropped our sliding rules and our jaw. Of course, we, poor students, couldn't afford this $500 gadget.

Well, it is somewhat clunky, but it works... somewhat.
